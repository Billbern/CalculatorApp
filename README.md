## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React [Context Api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->


### Continued development

The Calculator even though functional has some small bugs that needs fixing also i will like to add history to it so a user can select from his/her calculator history.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - This is the tailwindcss docs which also helped with most class names.
